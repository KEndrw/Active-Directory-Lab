<h2>Description</h2>
Active Directory (AD) is a powerful and widely-used directory service developed by Microsoft. It serves as a centralized and hierarchical database for managing and organizing network resources in a Windows-based environment. AD plays a huge role in network administration by providing a structured framework for user authentication, authorization, and resource management. It enables IT administrators to efficiently control access, enforce security policies, and streamline user and device management across an organization's network. With the provided feauters for domain management, group policy enforcement, and directory services, Active Directory is an important tool for maintaining the integrity, security, and scalability of Windows-based networks in both enterprise and business settings.
